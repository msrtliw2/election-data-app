    "content": "Rare 'Black Moon' to take place this month won't happen again until 2027\nA hidden 'Black Moon' is coming this month. But what is it, and why is it so special?\nNews\nBethan Finighan\n14:03, 07 Aug 2025\nA Black Moon is coming - but you won't be able to see it\n(Image: Getty Images)\nAll eyes are on the\nMoon\nthis week as the full Sturgeon Moon lights up skies in just days time.\n‌\nBut there's also a rare phenomenon happening that you\nwon't\nsee: A 'Black Moon' will happen on August 23, marking the only one of its kind this year.\n‌\nUnlike the terms 'full Moon' or 'new Moon', a 'Black Moon' isn't an official astronomical term. Instead it refers to a rare occurrence in the lunar calendar, typically involving extra new Moons in a month or season.\n‌\nIt is the new Moon's equivalent of a 'Blue Moon', an extra full Moon in a month or season. This is where we get the expression \"once in a Blue Moon\", due to the rarity of this phenomenon.\nThis month's event is what is known as a seasonal Black Moon. Typically, each season has three new Moons, but occasionally a fourth slips in – and the third of these is referred to as a Black Moon.\nThe last Black Moon happened just eight months ago in December 2024 and that was a monthly one, meaning it was the second new Moon within a single calendar month.\n‌\nTher 2027 Black Moon will also bring a total solar eclipse\n(Image: Getty Images)\nThe next won't occur until 2027, according to Starwalk, following the new Moon that will also bring a\nspectacular 6-minute-long total solar eclipse\non August 2, 2027.\nCan you see a Black Moon?\nBlack Moons are types of new Moons, which occur when the Moon is positioned between the Sun and the Earth. This means its sunlit side faces away from us, making it invisible in the night sky.\n‌\nWhile the Moon itself won't be visible, the absence of its glow creates some of the darkest skies of the month. For stargazers and astrophotographers, this offers the perfect opportunity to spot faint celestial objects like the Milky Way, planets or deep-sky objects.\nThe Sturgeon Moon is coming too\nIf you'd rather catch a glimpse of a glowing Moon, this week is your chance.\nAugust 9 brings the full Sturgeon Moon\n, named after the time of year when sturgeon fish – a large, prehistoric-looking fish – were most widely and easily caught in the Northern Hemisphere.\nThe Sturgeon Moon won't rise very high above the horizon\n(Image: Getty Images)\nArticle continues below\nThe Sturgeon Moon will peak at 8.54am BST on Saturday (August 9), after the Moon will have set. The best time to see the full Moon rise is at around 9pm on August 9, depending on where you are in the UK. It will rise in the southeast and set in the west-southwest at around 7am on August 10.\nLike this summer's Strawberry Moon and Buck Moon, the Sturgeon Moon won't rise very high above the horizon, meaning it could appear bigger than usual in a phenomenon called 'Moon illusion'.",

Baleba was excellent for the Seagulls last season, establishing himself as one of the Premier League's most highly-rated youngsters.\n‌\nCapable of doing a little bit of everything in the engine room, the 21-year-old would provide the energy, aggression and ball-carrying expertise United sorely lack in midfield. However, it remains to be seen if United will be able to fund a deal for him amid their ongoing pursuit of RB Leipzig striker\nBenjamin Sesko\n.\nSigned from Lille in August 2023, Baleba has gone from strength-to-strength in Brighton colours, producing a collection of eye-catching midfield performances. His all-round game makes him a very attractive player.\nTaking inspiration from\nManchester City\nmidfield star Rodri, Baleba revealed in May that he has ambitions of winning the Ballon d'Or in the future, admitting he has earned encouragement from\nPremier League\ncolleagues, including United ace Cunha.\nArticle continues below\n\"Declan Rice, Matheus Cunha, Joelinton, they've all told me I've got it in me,\" Baleba told\nThe Sun\nearlier this summer. \"I want to win the Ballon d'Or like Rodri.\n\"I watched him during the Euros and before his injury I played against him and time I got the ball, he was right in front of me. It was my first game against Manchester City, and it was very difficult.\n\"He made it so hard to dribble or pass. That showed his class. His success has opened the door for midfielders like us to believe we can win the Ballon d'Or someday.\"\n‌\nKICK OFF - Man United pre-season guide 2025/26\nThe countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our\npre-season guide\nis the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.\nAs well as in-depth analysis and opinion on your club, we turn the spotlight on every team battling for top-flight glory - or simply survival in the toughest league in the world!\nAlso full fixtures guide so you don't miss a game in what is set to be a thrilling season.\nGet your copy\nNOW\nHere at the Manchester Evening News, we're dedicated to bringing you the best Manchester United coverage and analysis.\nMake sure you don't miss out on the latest United news by joining our free WhatsApp group.

    "content": "What the Bank of England interest rate cut means for your mortgage and money\nThe average homeowner on a tracker mortgage will see a nearly £29 reduction in their monthly payments\nNews\nCharlotte Fisher\n13:51, 07 Aug 2025\nThe Bank announced it was cutting rates today, August 7\n(Image: Getty Images)\nThe\nBank of England\nannounced its interest rate decision earlier today, declaring that it is\nreducing the UK base rate by 0.25 percentage points\ndown to 4 per cent, meaning rates are now at their lowest since March 2023. The decision is expected to reduce mortgage payments for many around the country by nearly £29 a month.\n‌\nBanking and\nfinance\nindustry body UK Finance calculated that the reduction in the base rate will mean the typical mortgage holder on a deal that directly tracks the base rate will pay £28.97 per month less, based on the average balance outstanding. Over a year, this adds up to a reduction of nearly £350 (£347.64).\n‌\nThose on a standard variable rate (SVR) deal could see their monthly mortgage payments reduce by £13.87 on average, adding up to an annual saving of £166.44 – provided the lender passes on the base rate cut in full.\n‌\nBorrowers often end up on an SVR when their initial deal ends and the rate is set by individual lenders but often follows movements in the base rate.\nNever miss a story with the MEN's daily Catch Up newsletter - get it in your inbox by signing up\nhere\nIt comes after\neconomists said the Bank of England policymakers are \"between a rock and a hard place\"\nfollowing recent data that shows the UK unemployment rate increased to 4.7 per cent in the three months to May - the highest level for four years - while average earnings growth, excluding bonuses, slowed to 5 per cent - its lowest level for almost three years.\n‌\nHomeowners on fixed-rate mortgages will see no immediate change, although thousands are due to remortgage in the months ahead.\nAround 900,000 fixed-rate mortgage deals are due to expire in the second half of 2025, according to UK Finance’s figures, with 1.6 million fixed deals having ended or being due to end across the whole of the year.\nCharles Roe, director of mortgages at UK Finance, said: “Today’s rate cut by the Bank of England takes us back to where we were just over two years ago when rates were last at 4%.\n‌\n“While most mortgage holders are on fixed-rate deals, the cut will be welcomed by those on tracker or variable rate mortgages. This rate reduction should also help new mortgage applicants, as affordability and overall borrowing costs could improve.”\nNicholas Mendes, mortgage technical manager at John Charcol said: “Mortgage rates have been edging lower in recent weeks, helped by falling swap rates and a fresh price war among lenders.\n“Many banks are off their annual targets, particularly on the purchase side, so they’re sharpening rates to compete for remortgage business instead. That’s why we’ve started to see a handful of five and two-year fixed rates priced below 3.8%, even as inflation remains above target.”\n‌\nHe said that for those borrowers “rolling off sub-2% pandemic-era deals this year, the gap between old and new repayments is still significant, but it’s narrowing. The payment shock is nowhere near what we were seeing 12 to 18 months ago.”\nMr Mendes added: “For anyone approaching the end of their current mortgage deal, it makes sense to start the process around four to six months before it expires, depending on your lender.\n“That gives you time to consider both a product transfer with your existing lender and the option of remortgaging to a new one. Most lenders will allow you to secure a rate early, which means that if\nthe market\nmoves against you and rates rise, you are protected.\n‌\n“If rates fall, there is often the opportunity to switch to a lower deal before completion, either with the same lender or a different one, provided you have kept an eye on fees, timelines and any cancellation clauses.”\nFinancial experts also say that the interest rate cut is, perhaps surprisingly, a huge boost for\nthe Pound\n.\nJoin the Manchester Evening News\nWhatsApp\ngroup\nHERE\n‌\nThe cost of borrowing is now at its lowest level for more than two years and the Pound Sterling is trading around 0.5% higher across the board today. But the BoE did upgrade its estimate of inflation peaking at 4% from 3.75%.\nShaun Sturgess, Director at Swansea-based Sturgess Mortgage Solutions said mortgage holders will be relieved by the news.\nHe said: \"The Bank of England’s decision to cut the base rate to 4% is a positive step for mortgage holders and buyers. It signals a shift in sentiment - and while we won’t see a flood of cheaper deals overnight, it does ease pressure on lenders and borrowers alike.\n‌\n\"Tracker mortgage holders will benefit immediately, and fixed rates could edge down further. For aspiring buyers, this may improve affordability and bring confidence back into the market.\n“Savers, however, may feel the pinch - it’s now more important than ever to review where your money is held.\"\nBen Thompson, Deputy CEO at Mortgage Advice Bureau, said it will be welcome news for aspiring homeowners.\n‌\nHe said: \"The Bank of England's latest rate reduction will provide even more incentive for aspiring homeowners to step onto the\nproperty ladder\n.\n\"It was already a good time to buy, but this latest move makes it even more attractive. Lenders are continually adjusting their criteria, and it's increasingly possible to borrow more than you could last year, opening up the mortgage market significantly.\n“However, we recognise a major challenge: many potential borrowers simply aren't aware of the full spectrum of mortgage options available to them.\n‌\n\"If homeownership felt out of reach to you before, today's climate offers a significantly stronger chance. With the expert guidance of a mortgage adviser, I strongly encourage aspiring buyers to take full advantage of the market and unlock the financial benefits and long-term security that owning a property offers.\"\nMatt Smith, a mortgage expert at Rightmove, said: “Lenders have been competing for business in a market which has the largest supply of homes for sale in a decade.\n“A combination of rate cuts and changes to buyer affordability criteria are helping many home movers to responsibly borrow more towards the home that they want.\n‌\n“The market expects there will be one more (Bank of England base rate) cut before the end of the year, with an outside chance of two. Any further cuts would likely see this cycle repeat again, with lenders using it as an opportunity to reduce rates a little more.\n“It bodes well for the second half of this year, with further mortgage rate reductions and stable prices likely to encourage more activity.”\nRachel Springall, a finance expert at Moneyfactscompare.co.uk, said: “The continuation of falling mortgage rates will instil a sense of confidence among borrowers.\n‌\n\"Lenders have also been relaxing stress tests to further support mortgage customers.”\nShe added: “In positive news, swap rates have been edging downwards once again in recent days, which will give lenders more scope to reduce fixed mortgage rates.\n“There remains a clear financial gain for borrowers to shift from a variable rate mortgage onto a cheaper fixed rate, as a typical mortgage borrower being charged the current average standard variable rate of 7.42% would be paying £372 more per month, compared to a typical two-year fixed rate.”\n‌\nMoneyfacts’ calculation was based on a £250,000 mortgage, being repaid over a 25-year term.\nMs Springall also said that base rate reductions “will spell further misery for savers”.\nShe said: “It is essential that savers do not wait around for too long to snap up the top rates on the market, particularly if they use their pots to supplement their monthly income.”\nArticle continues below\nAccording to Moneyfactscompare.co.uk, the average easy-access savings rate on the market in August is 2.68%, down from 3.15% in the same month a year ago.\nThe average easy-access Isa on the market in August offers 2.90% in interest, down from 3.36% a year earlier, the financial information website said.",

After filling in the form, he received no response, he said.\n“After the most recent accident, I sent them another email to say two years has gone by since I last emailed and nothing has happened”, he said.\n“It’s a health and safety problem because it’s a dangerous crossroads but I imagine that car insurance for residents on this road is higher because of the number of accidents.”\nResident Carol Bullock said the council has “got to move those bins”.\n“They juggled them around a bit, so the biggest bin was further away from the junction but easily the worst accident yet happened after that”, she said.\n“People just can’t see. It’s mad because it’s so easy to sort out and I’m quite surprised that they haven’t solved it.”\nSome residents say the problem is aggravated by the road being used as a “rat run” by motorists to avoid going through busy Seven Dials.\n“People come quite fast down here”, said learner driver Ghaia Shubber.\nCars driving along Windlesham Avenue may not see cars approaching from Windlesham Road\n(Image: The Argus)\nA spokeswoman for South East Coast Ambulance Service (SECAMB) said: “South East Coast Ambulance Service was called to reports of a road traffic collision shortly after 09:20hrs on 1 August 2025 on the junction between Temple Gardens and Windlesham Road, Brighton.\n“Ambulance crews assessed and treated two patients, one patient was taken to Royal Sussex County Hospital for further medical treatment and the second patient was discharged from our care on scene.”\nCouncillor Tim Rowkins, cabinet member for net zero and environmental services, said the bins could be moved further from a car park outside a building close to the junction.\nHe said : “We take the safety of residents seriously.\n“We know the precise location of where best to locate communal bins causes much discussion among residents, and agree in this case, it does need to move a little further away from the car park exit.\n“We will work hard to find a better location from the limited options open to us.”\nTransport\nBrighton And Hove\nShare\n0 Comments\nGet\ninvolved\nwith the news\nSend your news & photos\nLoading...\nShow more articles",

Weapons and related products were regulated in other ways.\nThe company said: “The development does not cause any harm to the appearance of the main building or the wider location and that removal of the extension would adversely impact on the business requirements of the appellant, with associated risk to local employment.\n“If the extension were to be removed, this would cause environmental harms through the loss of the embodied carbon in the existing structure and the potential for materials to enter into the waste stream as a result of the removal.”\nIn their decision, the planning inspector (ST Wilkinson) said the main issue is the effect on community cohesion and safeguarding people within the community who share protected characteristics.\nThe inspector recognised the application received approximately 1,000 comments from 650 objectors and four petitions against the proposals signed by 1,000 people.\nThe inspector noted the council’s decision included an equalities impact assessment (EqIA), highlighting tensions arising from the scheme amid “conflicts in Gaza and the Middle East”.\nHowever, in their decision, the inspector said there was only anecdotal evidence of hate crimes.\nThe inspector said: “There have also been reports to elected members from representatives of local ethnic groups that their members feel increasingly unsafe and isolated. However, no evidence is before me identifying a direct link between these concerns and the appeal scheme.\n“The appeal site is physically linked to and operationally used for ancillary warehousing purposes for the existing factory.\n“However, the outputs from the manufacturing process, namely military hardware is not a planning matter. The current operations are lawful in planning terms and the appeal scheme is ancillary to this purpose.\n“There is no evidence that the original grant of the temporary planning permission in 2018, has contributed to community tensions and adversely impacted on ethnic groups who share protected characteristics.\n“Whilst I acknowledge the strength and depth of these objections, it is important to distinguish between the scale of the proposed extension and the existing operations across the wider site.\n“The appeal scheme is for an extension to an existing factory located on an industrial/business estate.”\nThe inspector ruled there is no evidence that the appeal would adversely impact on groups who share protected characteristics and granted planning permission.\nL3 Harris’s neighbour and landlord, Paxton Access, has said that it planned to give notice to the company to vacate the premises when its lease expired in 2027.\nFrom 8am on August 12, a protest is being held in reaction to this decision outside the factory by the Stop L3 Harris campaign group.\nBrighton and Hove City Council\nLocal government\nPlanning and development\nShare\n0 Comments\nGet\ninvolved\nwith the news\nSend your news & photos\nLoading...\nShow more articles",

The strike was part of an escalating row between NHS bosses and the British Medical Association (BMA) over pay.\n“I was immensely sad to resign after being a member for more than 30 years,” said Mr Kotegaonkar,” who lives in Holcombe Brook.\n“The BMA has become a union run by, and serving those, who regard medicine as a job and a salary. Either you became a\ndoctor\nfor a job and money, or you see it as a profession. I saw it as a profession that was all about ethics, patient care, sacrifice, and being there to relieve pain.\n“You need to leave all the material considerations to one side. It’s a question of values, but those values have moved, and we as a society have become more materialistic. Society has changed.”\nREAD MORE:\nHow strikes by doctors affected Royal Bolton Hopsital\nResident doctors refuse to rule out further strikes\nDoctor receives his MBE from the Queen\nWhile sympathetic to\ndoctors’\nconcerns, and accepting there are reasonable grounds for strike action, he fears that it could undermine the very foundations of the NHS in the long term.\n“Striking risks destroying something that took years to create.\n“Patients should always come first, but those who strike are forgetting that. They should make their grievances known in ways other than striking.\n“People don’t become ill out of choice The wallet does not figure when the public are in pain. All people want is a place where they can go when they need help or are desperate, they want doctors to be there for them.\n“The public appreciates that doctors have a case for more money, but the BMA – and doctors – should prioritise the importance of compassion and humility.\nMr Kotegaonkar, who was awarded an MBE for his service to medicine and education, established his GP surgery in Spring Lane, Radcliffe, in 1980. Within the first six months he had 1,000 patients, growing to more than 5,000 by the time he retired.\nHe cites it as one of his most important achievements.\n“In creating a surgery, I created choice for the public. Choice increases competition and competition increases quality.”\nMr Kotegaonkar said his resignation has garnered support from a number of eminent figures within the medical profession.\n“I felt immensely sad having to resign from the BMA, but my heart is in the right place. For years I saw it through the eyes of a doctor. Now I see it through the eyes of the public.”\nMore:\n'Couldn't be prouder' - Fans praise Bury FC's kind gesture to club in crisis\nMore:\nThe ancient burial sites not far from Bury\nThe government and the BMA are set to restart talks in the coming days in a bid to end the long-running resident doctor dispute.\nIt comes after Dr Ross Nieuwoudt and Dr Melissa Ryan, co-chairs of the union’s resident doctors committee, met with the Health Secretary Wes Streeting on Tuesday.\nHealth\nPolitics\nShare\nGet\ninvolved\nwith the news\nSend your news & photos\nLoading...\nShow more articles",

I tried a slice and it was delicious, especially the woodfired homemade base.\n‌\nListen to our\nBrummie Mummies Podcast\non how to get your child 'school ready' for the new term:\nI had a Rustic Smash Burger (£11) which came as a double smashed patty with American cheese, pickles, lettuce, onion and burger sauce.

There were five in the bowl and they were large and filling and drizzled with stripy sauce. That's the thing with this food - it looks as good as it tastes, which is often the beauty of street food.\nWe shared a bowl of Cheesy Cajun Fries (£6.25) and Bacon and Ranch Fries (£8.25) which came skin-on and seasoned, topped with lots of cheese and sauce.\nIn all honesty, the portions here are very generous and we ordered way more than we needed for the three of us but it's hard to choose from such a great menu.\n‌\nThe staff kindly packed it into doggy bags for us to take home.
